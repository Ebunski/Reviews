### Built with

- React javascript
- CSS custom properties and dynamically rendered css classes
- Flexbox and grid

## My process

- I went through the mobile and desktop styles on the css files
- Created the layout of the components
- Gave the page life with the magic of javascript.

### What I learnt

1. Css:

Learnt how to style an avatar image - giving the class to the image tag.
Hero section negative margin and pseudo class background (z-index: -1)
Navbar with transparent bg
sidebar: scale, visibility and z-index transition on show.

2. React:
   First and foremost, i learnt the importance of default values. Had a bug that took me hours to solve.
   Default falues are important when dealing with map functions.
   That being said, i learnt about the onMouseOver event listener.
   Also learnt about event.target.textContent and .contains objects and got to practice .getBoundingClientRect()
   I was also able to put my debugging skills to test.
   Got to pratice using context.
   Practiced the useRef hook.
   Overall it was a very wonderful project.
