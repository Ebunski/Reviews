### Built with

## My process

- Gave the page life with the magic of javascript.

### What I learnt

1. Css:

Learnt how to delicately add box-shadows and general color scheme.
Learnt to use pseudo classes.

2. React:
   Learnt how to go through an index and handle end-of-array errors using a checker function.

   Overall it was a very wonderful project.
